## How to Play
It's like the game "Wordle" but instead, you're guessing classrooms at BU, with a picture of the classroom as a hint.

The player is prompted with a picture of a random classroom on the Charles River BU campus with a capacity of over 80 people, as well as a spot to input their guess of three characters and three integers -- respectively corresponding to the classroom and room number. Based on the photo displayed, the user can input their guess until their guess is correct. If the correct character or integer is in the correct spot, then it appears green. If the correct character or integer is in the wrong spot, then it appears yellow. If the character or integer is not at all in the classroomâ€™s ID, it appears red. After the user has guessed correctly, the number of total guesses is displayed.

## How to build Densmordle
A makefile was created. You should be able to type "make" to compile the files, then type "./Densmordle.exe" to play the game.

This game runs in C++ (note that it includes <windows.h>).
